title: "Parallel Programming of General-Purpose Programs Using Task-Based Programming Models"
collection: publications
category: workshops
permalink: /publication/2011-05-01-task-based-parallel-programming
excerpt: "This paper extends the Cilk programming model by introducing input, output, and inout dependency types on task arguments, enabling concise expression of complex parallelism patterns like pipelines and speculative execution in general-purpose programs. The proposed extensions improve code readability and maintain performance comparable to existing models."
