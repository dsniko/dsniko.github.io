As an educator, Dimitrios is committed to shaping the next generation of computer scientists through his instruction in [Computer Organization](https://cs.vt.edu/Undergraduate/courses/CS2506.html), [Systems and Networking Capstone](https://cs.vt.edu/Undergraduate/courses/CS4284.html), [Multiprocessor Programming](https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Courses/GradCourseDescriptions.html#CS510), and [Warehouse-Scale Computing](https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Courses/GradCourseDescriptions.html#CS5914). He has taught various courses in Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, and Parallel Programming and has been recognized numerous times for teaching excellence by his students and peers. His lectures have also been used as teaching material in industry research labs.

**Professional Service and Leadership:**

In service to the academic community, Dimitrios has held leadership positions with several prestigious computer systems conferences and journals. Since June 2024, he has chaired the Steering Committee of the [ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS)](https://www.ics-conference.org/). He chaired the Steering Committee of the [IEEE International Conference on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software](https://ispass.org) in 2022 and 2023. He has served as Program Chair of [HPDC](https://hpdc.sci.utah.edu/2026/) in 2026, [ICS](https://www.ics-conference.org) in 2022 and 2023 and of [IEEE CCGRID](http://datasys.cs.iit.edu/events/CCGrid2014/) in 2014. Additionally, he was the Program Area Chair of [SC](https://supercomputing.org) in 2014, [IPDPS](https://ipdps.org) in 2011, and [ICPP](https://www.icpp-conf.org) in 2007. He also served as General Chair of IEEE ISPASS in 2018 and [IEEE Cluster](https://clustercomp.org) in 2010 and 2018. Dimitrios is the recipient of two editorial excellence awards from the [IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=71) and [Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/sustainable-computing-informatics-and-systems). 


**University Leadership and Advocacy:**

In his administrative career, Dimitrios has held key academic leadership positions, such as the Head of the School of [Electronics, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science](https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/), Director of the [ECIT Global Innovation Institute](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ECIT+QUB&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=active), and Director of Research at [Queens University Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk).

The School also achieved the highest-ever research expenditures and unprecedented graduate and undergraduate student enrollment, establishing itself as a significant hub for computing workforce education and research excellence in the UK and Ireland. Dimitrios currently serves on the [CRA Leadership Academy Committee](https://cra.org/cra-leadership-academy-for-faculty/).

**Current Research and Opportunities:**

Dimitrios currently directs the [Performance Engineering for Emerging Architectures Laboratory (PEARL)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/performance-of-emerging-architectures-laboratory) at Virginia Tech and serves as the Associate Director of the [Stack@CS Center for Computer Systems](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Stack%40CS+VT&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=active). His mission is to promote convergent research that co-designs computing system stacks alongside engineering artifacts to tackle significant scientific challenges and urgent societal needs. Through this work, he continues to build bridges between principles of scalable computing systems and practical applications that address real-world problems.

**Education:**

Dimitrios earned his Diploma of Engineering in [Computer Engineering and Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr) from the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr), Greece, in 1996. This rigorous five-year program is considered academically equivalent to a qualification between a U.S. bachelor’s and master’s degree. He went on to receive his Master of Engineering in 1997 and completed his Ph.D. in 2000, both from the same institution and in the same discipline.

His doctoral studies were guided by the late [Theodore S. Papatheodorou](http://old.math.upatras.gr/~vrahatis/papers/other/AkrivisDGHKNSV16_APPL_NUMER_MATH_104_pp99-102_2016.pdf), a gentleman and unassuming researcher who was nonetheless a pioneer in the early days of parallel and distributed computing. Dimitrios later continued his research as a postdoctoral scholar under the mentorship of [Constantine Polychronopoulos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/constantinepolychronopoulos/), a world-renowned authority in parallelizing compilers and a successful innovator in web technologies, streaming video, and transport protocol optimization through multi-threading.
